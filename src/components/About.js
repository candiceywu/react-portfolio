                <p>I'm new here, but I think you are too.</p>
                <p>I've spent my life working in ocean resource policy and resilience management, but I'm in the midst of switching career angles - as in, I still want to focus my life's energy on conservation and stewardship, but just through a new approach.</p>
                <p>This year's goal is to couple my new skills in programming with my tried-and-true talents as a strategist and project manager to strengthen my contribution towards a collective effort. As technological advancements become more palpable, I want to ensure I'm right alongside these solutions as they tackle our global climate crisis.</p>
                <p>As Jacques Cousteau once said: "The sea, the great unifier, is man's only hope. Now, as never before, the old phrase has a literal meaning: we are all in the same boat."</p>
                <p>So, let's do this together.</p>
